# Customer Segmentation using Clustering

- Performed exploratory data analysis using the WineKMC dataset in order to learn about the customers purchasing behavior. 

- Used customers behaviors (whether or not they purchased wine based on an offer) as a way to group similar minded customers together.

- Used K-means clustering algorithm to predict and help formulate future offers.
